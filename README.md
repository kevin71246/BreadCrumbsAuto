MediaWiki Breadcrumbs extension

A MediaWiki can be created and structured many ways.  This extension creates breadcrumbs automatically if you use a given structure.  

The structure is as follows, as an example: 
-Starting with the Main Page, you create 3 additional pages (Page A, Page B, & Page C) using the [[New Page]] format on the Main Page.
-On Page A, you create 3 new pages: Page 1, Page 2, & Page 3

Breadcrumbs will automatically be created on Page 2 as such: 
Main Page > Page A > Page 2

It's certainly possible you may link from Page C to Page 2.  This will show up as an additional breadcrumb.  There is a setting to limit how many breadcrumbs get generated for a page.

There are numerous settings.
